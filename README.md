# Joint Savings with Solidity Contrtacts

## Background

* To automate the creation of joint savings accounts, you’ll create a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. Your smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institution’s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account

## Instructions

* Create a Joint Savings Account Contract in Solidity

* Compile and Deploy Your Contract in the JavaScript VM

* Interact with Your Deployed Smart Contract
